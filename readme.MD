1. Change directories as needed. Right now the scripts are expecting the folders `C:/Users/Alex/Documents/Data/GNR/Country profiles` `C:/Users/Alex/Documents/Data/GNR/Country profile PDFs` exist to hold the generated PNGs and PDFs.
2. Generate chart PNGs with `charts.R`
3. Render PDFs with `render.py`
